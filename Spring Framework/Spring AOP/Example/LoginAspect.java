/**
 * Aspect class that contains advice for handling banking operations such as 
 * validating PIN before withdrawals, logging after PIN changes, and handling 
 * exceptions when invalid PIN is used.
 * 
 * This class contains several types of advice:
 * - @Before: Executed before the method execution.
 * - @AfterReturning: Executed after the method execution if no exception occurs.
 * - @AfterThrowing: Executed if an exception is thrown in the advised method.
 * - @Around: Allows control over the method execution and can prevent it.
