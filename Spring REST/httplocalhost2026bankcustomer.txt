Without @JsonIgnore
You get a circular reference:

Loan → Customer → Loan → Customer → ... (infinite loop)

This leads to serialization errors or oversized/infinite JSON.

✅ Benefits of Using @JsonIgnore
Benefit	Description
Prevents infinite recursion	Useful in bi-directional relationships
Controls API response payload	Hides sensitive or unnecessary data from API consumers
Reduces payload size	Keeps responses clean and lightweight

⚠️ Note
Use @JsonIgnore only when you are sure the field is not needed in your JSON output/input.

If you still want to serialize it in one direction (e.g., parent → child but not child → parent), then @JsonManagedReference / @JsonBackReference is a better option.
